# üè° Forecasting Home Prices: Data Visualization & Predictive Analysis (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting housing prices using **Power BI**.  
It combines **descriptive analytics, correlation analysis, and regression modeling** to uncover key insights into property values and market trends.  
The interactive dashboard helps users explore factors such as **square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, year built, and neighborhood** to better understand their impact on home prices.

## Problem Statement
- Existing datasets often lack detail and fail to capture complex real estate market dynamics.  
- Traditional models struggle to incorporate multiple variables and qualitative factors.  
- Need for an **interactive visualization tool** to make real estate insights more accessible.  

## Key Features
- **Neighborhood Analysis** ‚Äì Compare housing distribution across rural, suburban, and urban areas.  
- **Property Feature Insights** ‚Äì Explore how bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage affect price.  
- **Construction Trends** ‚Äì Understand how house construction evolved from the 1960s to 2020s.  
- **Correlation & Regression** ‚Äì Identify strongest predictors of home price (square footage shows highest correlation).  
- **Interactive Dashboard** ‚Äì Dynamic filters for year built, square footage, and property features.  

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation** ‚Äì Structured datasets for Power BI analysis.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** ‚Äì Distribution, trend, and breakdown visualizations.  
3. **Statistical Modeling** ‚Äì Correlation and regression analysis (R¬≤ ‚âà 0.57).  
4. **Dashboard Development** ‚Äì Interactive visualizations in Power BI for decision-making.  

## Insights
- Square footage is the strongest predictor of price (correlation: 0.75).  
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms impact pricing but with weaker correlations.  
- Year built and neighborhood show limited predictive power.  
- Interactive dashboard enables exploration of trends for **investment and pricing strategy**.  

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** (Data Visualization & Dashboarding)  
- **Excel / CSV datasets** (Data Source)  
- **Statistical Methods** ‚Äì Correlation, Regression  


## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **data visualization + predictive analytics** can provide valuable insights for real estate markets and guide investment decisions.
